* Releases

- Releases 1.8.0
  * Make the example hello_net.zig return a proper HTTP response in the --http mode.
  * Allow setting listening port in hello_net server example.

- Releases 1.7.0
  * Add a network based JSON-RPC server example, over either HTTP or plain TCP.
  * Use more rich RunStatus instead of bool for return value of runXX().
    Allow stream to be canceled via the RunStatus.end_stream flag.
  * Flush writer at the end of writing a Content-Length based message.

- Releases 1.6.0
  * Breaking change. FileLogger allocates its own write_buf now instead of taking in a passed in buffer, making it easier to use and more self contained.

- Releases 1.5.0
  * Breaking change. Simplify RpcPipeline.runRequest() API by removing of the passed in Allocator.
  * Breaking change. Simplify dispatcher API. Remove the need to pass in an Allocator to dispatch() and dispatchEnd(). The Dispatcher object is expected to manage its own allocator as needed.
  * Redo and formalize extended handlers on RpcDispatcher. Add OnErrorHandler. Add tests.

- Releases 1.4.0
  * Breaking change!
    Rename RpcRegistry to RpcDispatcher. Rename rpc_registry.zig to rpc_dispatcher.zig. Add stream.runByDelimiter() and stream.runByContentLength() to take on RpcDispatcher as parameter.

- Releases 1.3.0
  * Breaking change! Migrated to use Zig 0.15.1 API.

- Release 1.1
  * Add Universal message handling.
    * Message-based parsing, for both request and response.
    * Message-based execution via rpc_pipeline.runMessage(), for both request and response.
    * Message-based streaming, handling both request and response in the stream.
  * RpcRegistry supports extended handlers: pre-dispatch, post-dispatch, and fallback handler.
  * Fallback handler for handling any unregistered request methods.
  * Add RpcRequest.parseRpcRequestOwned() to handle memory ownership of passed in JSON string.
  * Add RpcResponse.parseRpcResponseOwned() to handle memory ownership of passed in JSON string.
  * Remove error union from the return value of response.parseRpcResponse().
  * Add readHttpHeaders() to parse all HTTP-style headers, not just Content-Length.
  * Add the LSP client example.

- Release 1.0.1
  * Minor bug fixes.

- Release 1.0
  * Feature completed.  Initial release.
